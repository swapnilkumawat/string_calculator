# String Calculator â€“ Ruby Implementation

This project is a Ruby implementation of the **String Calculator**, a coding exercise designed to practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The goal of this assignment is to build a calculator that sums numbers given in a string format, while following good coding practices such as writing clean, testable, and maintainable code.

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Description

Implement a `StringCalculator` class with a method `add` that takes a string of numbers and returns their sum.

### Requirements:
- The input is a string containing numbers separated by commas or newlines.
- An empty string should return `0`.
- A single number should return its integer value.
- Two or more numbers should return the correct sum.
- The input can optionally specify a custom delimiter in the format `//[delimiter]\n[numbersâ€¦]`.
- Negative numbers should raise an error with a message listing all negative numbers.
